# Intruder-Detection-and-Alert-System
The project deals with face recognition using CNN to detect whether a person is a member of the family. The moment a stranger is detected in absence of a family member, the program alerts the family members by sending a broadcast to the designated Telegram channel as well as sending personal messages to the members.

The program will generate images in the first run and save it in a folder 'data_for_training'. Let the program generate images of atleast 2 of the family members by providing the user input at the time.

conf.ipynb consists of credentials of the Twilio account and the Telegram bot and Channel IDs that are used for sending alerts. Edit the file by filling the missing values with personal credentials.
