# Intruder-Detection-and-Alert-System
The project deals with face recognition using CNN to detect whether a person is a member of the family. The moment a stranger is detected in absence of a family member, the program alerts the family members by sending a broadcast to the designated Telegram channel as well as sending personal messages to the members.
